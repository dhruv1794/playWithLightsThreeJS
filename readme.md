# Three.js 

This is a experimental project to play with lights. It has `lil-gui` integration which helps you understand Lights better with Threejs. Feel free to clone this repository and play around with it.  I showcase various lights using threeJS -> Ambient Light, Directional Light, HemiSphere Light, Point Light, ReactArea Light and SpotLight. Please leave feedback if any.
